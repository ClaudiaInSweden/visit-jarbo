# Visit Järbo


## Introduction

### Project Description
Visit Järbo is a site that provides information to travellers about what to expect when coming to Järbo. 

Its vicinity to the ski resort Kungsberget, makes the small town of Järbo an ideal place to stay for travellers who want to avoid the overcrowded area of Kungsberget. Järbos surroundings make it an ideal place to stay when visitors want to take a rest from their hectic everyday life. 

### Project Purpose
There are are couple of international companies in the area and their employees and business partners are potential visitors who do need information about the place in English


## Features

### Navigation

- The respsonsive navigation bar on top of the page includes links to the Home, Nature, Activities, Gallery, Contact us. The Visit Järbo logo is linked to the Start page. It's identical on each page to enable easy navigation.
- It allows users to navigate between pages on all devices without needing to use the "back"-button. 


### Home   

The Home page is the starting point for users. It provides a short overview of what Järbo has to offer


### Nature

The pages describes in short what the user can expect being outdoor in the area. 

### Activities

The page describes in short what kind of outdoor activities the user can enjoy.
There are also links to external information pages and service providers. The links open in a new tab to allow easy navigation without needing to use the back-button.. 

### Gallery

The page shows images of the area as well as wild animals that the user might be able to see during the stay. 
The images include alt-tags to provide relevant information when screen readers are used. 


### Contact us

The contact form enables user to request more information about outdoor activities, listed on the activities page. It includes fields for name, email and radio buttons to select.

### Footer

The footer area contains links to relevant social media sites (Facebook, X (Twitter), and Instagram) to encourage users to keep connected. The icons include alterntive text to provide relevant information when screen readers are used. All links open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 


### Features left to implement
As users might want to receive information about more than one topic I originally used checkboxes for the Contact us page. However, after som trials and Google research I found out that this requires Javascript which was not part of course so far.
If there is interest from local service providers, more and detailed information about activities and accommodation could be included. It would also be possible to create Facebook and Instagram accounts for "Visit Järbo" and allow a group of people to post updates, to replace the empty links to real content.

## Browser Testing
Functionality, links, layout and responsiveness was tested with following browsers without any issues:
- Microsoft Edge Version 117.0.2045.47
- Firefox Version 118.0.1
- Brave Version 1.58.135
- Google Chrome Version 116.0.5845.188

- Dell Laptop 14"
- HP Laptop 17"
- Dell Screen 24"
- Samsung Galaxy 22S Ultra
- iPhone 8 


#### Findings under testing

- While input-text:hover border colour looked correct on Google Chrome and Edge I noticed a blue border on Mozilla. I realized that some default border style needs to be the reason and found the solution on the [Mozilla MDN Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
