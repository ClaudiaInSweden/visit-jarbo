# Visit Järbo

## Introduction

Visit Järbo is a site that shall provide information to travellers about what to expect when coming to this small town. Its vicinity to Kungsberget, which is a small but known ski resort relatively close to Stockholm makes Järbo an ideal place to stay when a traveller does not want to stay in the overcrowded area of Kungsberget. Järbos surroundings make it an ideal place to stay when you want to take a rest from your hectic everyday life. Visitors can go on hiking or bicycle tours without meeting other people, if they want so.

I am living in the area and I feel that this little town needs to have its own website in English to show potential visitors what a beautiful place this is and things you can do and places to visit when you come here.
